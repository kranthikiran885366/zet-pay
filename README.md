## ‚ú® Core Features & How They Work

This section details the primary functionalities of the Zet Pay app.

### üí≥ **I. Payments & Wallet**

*   **UPI Payments:**
    *   _Send to Contact:_ Select a saved contact (synced with phone/app contacts) and enter the amount. App uses the contact's primary UPI ID or prompts selection if multiple exist.
    *   _Send to Bank/UPI ID:_ Manually enter the recipient's UPI ID or Bank Account + IFSC code. App verifies the UPI ID/Account Holder name before proceeding.
    *   _Scan & Pay:_ Uses the device camera (`src/app/(features)/scan/page.tsx`) to scan any UPI QR code. Decodes the QR data (payee UPI ID, name, amount if present) and pre-fills the payment confirmation screen (`src/app/(features)/pay/page.tsx`).
    *   _Payment Confirmation:_ User reviews details (Payee Name, UPI ID, Amount) and authorizes payment via UPI PIN (handled securely via PSP SDK/backend integration).
*   **Wallet:**
    *   _Top-up:_ Add funds to the Zet Pay wallet using UPI, Net Banking, or Debit/Credit Card via integrated Payment Gateways (`src/services/wallet.ts` interacts with backend `/wallet/topup`).
    *   _Management:_ View current balance (updated in real-time via WebSocket `useRealtimeBalance` hook) and transaction history specific to the wallet.
    *   _Pay via Wallet:_ Use wallet balance as a payment source for recharges, bills, bookings, or P2P transfers (`src/services/wallet.ts` interacts with backend `/wallet/pay`).
*   **UPI Lite:**
    *   _Enable/Disable:_ Users can enable UPI Lite via their linked bank account (if supported) (`src/services/upiLite.ts` interacts with backend `/upi/lite/enable`). Balance is stored on-device/SIM.
    *   _Top-up:_ Add funds (up to ‚Çπ2000) from the linked bank account to the UPI Lite balance (`src/services/upiLite.ts` interacts with backend `/upi/lite/topup`).
    *   _Payment:_ Make small-value payments (up to ‚Çπ500) instantly without UPI PIN (`src/services/upiLite.ts`).
*   **UPI Autopay (Mandates):**
    *   _Setup:_ Users can authorize merchants (e.g., Netflix, SIPs) for recurring debits up to a certain limit and frequency (`src/services/autopay.ts` interacts with backend `/autopay/mandates`). Requires UPI PIN authorization.
    *   _Management:_ View active/paused/cancelled mandates. Pause, resume, or cancel mandates (`src/app/(features)/autopay/page.tsx`, `src/services/autopay.ts`).
*   **Debit/Credit Card Payments:**
    *   _Save Cards:_ Securely save card details (tokenized via backend/PG) for faster checkouts (`src/services/cards.ts` interacts with backend `/cards`).
    *   _Pay Bills/Shop:_ Use saved cards (requires CVV and potentially OTP/3D Secure via PG) for various payments (`src/services/paymentGatewayService.ts` interacts with backend `/payments/card`).
    *   _Bill Payments:_ Pay credit card bills for any bank by entering card number and amount (`src/app/(features)/bills/credit-card/page.tsx`).
*   **Pay Later (BNPL):**
    *   _Activation:_ Eligible users activate Pay Later facility provided by partner NBFC/Bank (`src/services/bnpl.ts` interacts with backend `/bnpl/activate`).
    *   _Usage:_ Use BNPL credit limit for eligible transactions (UPI, bills, etc.).
    *   _Billing & Repayment:_ Receive monthly statements and repay the due amount via UPI, Wallet, or Bank transfer (`src/app/(features)/bnpl/page.tsx`).
*   **‚≠ê Unique Feature: Smart Wallet Bridge (UPI Limit Resolver):**
    *   _Problem:_ User hits UPI daily limit (‚Çπ1 Lakh).
    *   _Zet Fix:_ If enabled by user (KYC verified, toggle ON in Settings) and payment amount is within fallback limit (e.g., ‚Çπ5k), the app automatically uses the Zet Pay wallet balance to complete the transaction instantly.
    *   _Recovery:_ The backend schedules a recovery task. After midnight (when UPI limit resets), it attempts to auto-debit the used amount from the user's primary linked bank account and credit it back to their Zet Pay wallet (`src/services/recoveryService.ts`, `backend/services/recoveryService.ts`).
    *   _User Experience:_ Payment succeeds seamlessly. User gets notified about the fallback and recovery.
*   **‚≠ê Unique Feature: Cardless Cash Withdrawal:**
    *   _Process:_ User finds nearby "Zet Agents" (partner shops) on a map (`src/app/(features)/cash-withdrawal/page.tsx`). User selects agent, enters amount. App generates a secure OTP and a QR code (`src/services/cash-withdrawal.ts` interacts with backend `/cash-withdrawal/initiate`). User shows OTP/QR to agent. Agent verifies via their app, dispenses cash. Funds deducted from user's wallet/linked account.
    *   _Security:_ Time-bound OTP/QR, agent verification needed.

### üì± **II. Recharge & Bill Payments**

*   **Mobile Recharge (Prepaid/Postpaid):**
    *   _Operator/Circle Detection:_ Auto-detects operator (Jio, Airtel, etc.) and circle based on entered mobile number (`src/app/(features)/recharge/[type]/page.tsx` interacts with backend detection). User can manually override.
    *   _Plan Browser:_ Fetches and displays available plans categorized (Recommended, Data, Unlimited, etc.) from backend/aggregator (`src/services/recharge.ts`). Includes plan details (price, validity, data, SMS, talktime).
    *   _AI Recommendations:_ Suggests plans based on user's past recharge history and inferred usage patterns (using Genkit Flow `recommendRechargePlans`).
    *   _Validity Tracking:_ (Future) Store last recharge details to show remaining validity.
    *   _Payment:_ Processed via selected method (Wallet, UPI, Card).
*   **DTH Recharge:** Similar flow to mobile - select operator, enter Customer ID, browse/select plan or enter amount, pay.
*   **FASTag Recharge:** Select issuer bank, enter vehicle number, enter amount, pay.
*   **Utility Bills (Electricity, Water, Gas, Broadband, etc.):**
    *   Select provider/biller.
    *   Enter Consumer ID/Account Number.
    *   App fetches bill amount (if supported by biller via BBPS/API integration) or user enters manually (`src/services/bills.ts`).
    *   Pay the bill.
*   **Other Payments:** Loan EMIs, Insurance Premiums, Education Fees, Subscriptions (OTT), Metro Card Recharge, Data Card, Intl. Calling Cards. Flow involves selecting biller, entering identifier (policy no, loan no, student ID, etc.), fetching/entering amount, and paying.
*   **‚≠ê Unique Feature: Recharge Undo:** Within a short window (e.g., 5-10 minutes, configurable), user can request cancellation of a potentially wrong mobile/DTH recharge if the recharge hasn't already been consumed/processed fully by the operator (`src/services/recharge.ts` interacts with backend `/recharge/cancel/:transactionId`).
*   **‚≠ê Unique Feature: Bill Reminders:** Users can manually add reminders for recurring bills (rent, fees) or the app can potentially auto-detect upcoming due dates from bill fetch history (`src/app/(features)/reminders/page.tsx`). Sends push notifications.

### üöå **III. Travel & Transit**
