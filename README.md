## ‚ú® Core Features & How They Work

This section details the primary functionalities of the Zet Pay app, grouped by category.

### üí≥ **I. Payments & Wallet**

*   **UPI Payments:**
    *   _Send to Contact:_ Select a saved contact (synced with phone/app contacts) and enter the amount. App uses the contact's primary UPI ID or prompts selection if multiple exist. Verification before sending. (`src/app/(features)/send/mobile/page.tsx`)
    *   _Send to Bank/UPI ID:_ Manually enter the recipient's UPI ID or Bank Account + IFSC code. App verifies the UPI ID/Account Holder name before proceeding. (`src/app/(features)/send/bank/page.tsx`)
    *   _Scan & Pay:_ Uses the device camera (`src/app/(features)/scan/page.tsx`) to scan any UPI QR code. Decodes the QR data (payee UPI ID, name, amount if present) and pre-fills the payment confirmation screen (`src/app/(features)/pay/page.tsx`). Supports QR code upload from gallery.
    *   _Receive Money (My QR):_ Displays user's static UPI QR code for others to scan and pay (`src/app/(features)/scan/page.tsx` - My QR Tab).
    *   _Payment Confirmation:_ User reviews details (Payee Name, UPI ID, Amount) and authorizes payment via UPI PIN (handled securely via PSP SDK/backend integration). (`src/app/(features)/pay/page.tsx`)
*   **Wallet:**
    *   _Top-up:_ Add funds to the Zet Pay wallet using UPI, Net Banking, or Debit/Credit Card via integrated Payment Gateways (`src/services/wallet.ts` interacts with backend `/wallet/topup`).
    *   _Management:_ View current balance (updated in real-time via WebSocket `useRealtimeBalance` hook) and transaction history specific to the wallet. (`src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/(features)/history/page.tsx`)
    *   _Pay via Wallet:_ Use wallet balance as a payment source for recharges, bills, bookings, or P2P transfers (`src/services/wallet.ts` interacts with backend `/wallet/pay`).
*   **UPI Lite:**
    *   _Enable/Disable:_ Users can enable UPI Lite via their linked bank account (if supported) (`src/services/upiLite.ts`, `src/app/(features)/upi-lite/page.tsx`). Balance is stored on-device/SIM.
    *   _Top-up:_ Add funds (up to ‚Çπ2000) from the linked bank account to the UPI Lite balance (`src/services/upiLite.ts`, `src/app/(features)/upi-lite/page.tsx`).
    *   _Payment:_ Make small-value payments (up to ‚Çπ500) instantly without UPI PIN (`src/services/upiLite.ts`).
*   **UPI Autopay (Mandates):**
    *   _Setup:_ Users authorize merchants (e.g., Netflix, SIPs) for recurring debits up to a certain limit and frequency (`src/services/autopay.ts`, `src/app/(features)/autopay/page.tsx`). Requires UPI PIN authorization.
    *   _Management:_ View active/paused/cancelled mandates. Pause, resume, or cancel mandates (`src/app/(features)/autopay/page.tsx`, `src/services/autopay.ts`).
*   **Debit/Credit Card Payments:**
    *   _Save Cards:_ Securely save card details (tokenized via backend/PG) for faster checkouts (`src/services/cards.ts`, `src/app/(features)/profile/cards/page.tsx`).
    *   _Pay Bills/Shop:_ Use saved cards (requires CVV and potentially OTP/3D Secure via PG) for various payments (`src/services/paymentGatewayService.ts`).
    *   _Bill Payments:_ Pay credit card bills for any bank by entering card number and amount (`src/app/(features)/bills/credit-card/page.tsx`).
*   **Pay Later (BNPL):**
    *   _Activation:_ Eligible users activate Pay Later facility provided by partner NBFC/Bank (`src/services/bnpl.ts`).
    *   _Usage:_ Use BNPL credit limit for eligible transactions (UPI, bills, etc.).
    *   _Billing & Repayment:_ Receive monthly statements and repay the due amount via UPI, Wallet, or Bank transfer (`src/app/(features)/bnpl/page.tsx`).
*   **‚≠ê Unique Feature: Smart Wallet Bridge (UPI Limit Resolver):**
    *   _Problem:_ User hits UPI daily limit (‚Çπ1 Lakh).
    *   _Zet Fix:_ If enabled by user (KYC verified, toggle ON in Profile Settings) and payment amount is within fallback limit (e.g., ‚Çπ5k), the app automatically uses the Zet Pay wallet balance to complete the transaction instantly. (`src/app/(features)/profile/security/page.tsx`, `backend/controllers/upiController.js`)
    *   _Recovery:_ The backend schedules a recovery task. After midnight (when UPI limit resets), it attempts to auto-debit the used amount from the user's primary linked bank account and credit it back to their Zet Pay wallet (`src/services/recoveryService.ts`, `backend/services/recoveryService.ts`).
    *   _User Experience:_ Payment succeeds seamlessly. User gets notified about the fallback and recovery.
*   **‚≠ê Unique Feature: Cardless Cash Withdrawal:**
    *   _Process:_ User finds nearby "Zet Agents" (partner shops) on a map (`src/app/(features)/cash-withdrawal/page.tsx`). User selects agent, enters amount. App generates a secure OTP and a QR code (`src/services/cash-withdrawal.ts`). User shows OTP/QR to agent. Agent verifies via their app, dispenses cash. Funds deducted from user's wallet/linked account.
    *   _Security:_ Time-bound OTP/QR, agent verification needed.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone:** `git clone <repository-url> && cd <repo-name>`
2.  **Install Root Dependencies:** `npm install` (or `yarn`)
3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:** `cd backend && npm install` (or `yarn`) && `cd ..`
4.  **Setup `.env` files:** Create and populate `.env` in root and `backend/` as per above. Ensure Firebase credentials are correct.
5.  **Run Backend Server:** (Terminal 1) `cd backend && npm run dev`
6.  **Run Genkit Dev Server:** (Terminal 2, from root) `npm run genkit:dev` (or `genkit:watch`)
7.  **Run Frontend Dev Server:** (Terminal 3, from root) `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) (or your frontend port). The backend runs on port 9003 by default.
