This document outlines the (conceptual) Online Shopping and Grocery Shopping features within the Zet Pay application.

## 1. Introduction

Zet Pay's eCommerce module aims to provide users with an integrated shopping experience, allowing them to browse products, add to cart, and make purchases from various online stores or for groceries, all within the super app. This feature would typically involve integrations with eCommerce platforms, aggregators, or direct partnerships.
